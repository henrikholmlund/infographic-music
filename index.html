            <p>The cornerstone of all music that we hear is rhythm, without rhythm there would be nothing to discern the melodies and chords from random noise. Rhythm is the scaffolding and base-plate which supports and defines all other melody and harmony.</p>
            <p>To explain just what rhythm is is a bit difficult. Rhythm is one of those things that don’t translate well to the written page, one has to experience it to understand what it’s all about.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="rhythmbox2">
            <p>But! A simple way to think about would be that rhythm is kind of like walking.
                You tend to walk in a certain, perhaps even steady, pace. This pace is what in music is referred to as ‘tempo’.</p>
            <p> Now imagine that you count each step up to four, and that you start over again once you’ve reached four. Like so, one-two-three-four, one-two-three-four, and repeat ad infinitum.
                What you have just counted is four quarter notes in a 4/4 measure.</p>

        <div id="rhythmbox3">
            <p> A measure is defined as the space in which all of the musical action takes place. A measure can have different lengths depending on what time signature each piece of music has.
                This means that the measure in 4/4 time is four quarter notes long, if we had another time signature, let’s say 3/4 time then each measure would be three beats (or quarter notes) long.</p>
            <p>4/4 in this case means that there are four quarter notes to each measure. The first number tells you how many of something there are in the measure and the second tells you of what, which is quarter notes in our case.</p>
            <p>Sounds confusing? Hopefully we will be able to sort things out  and make you understand just a little bit more exactly what rhythm is by the end of this tutorial. </p>

        <h2>Whole notes</h2>
        <p>Whole notes are the simplest and easiest note value to understand, its value is equal to four beats in 4/4 time. One can simply say that it takes up the entire measure, and it lasts for four beats</p>
        <p>So if you imagine once again that you are walking and counting up to four that the whole note starts when you count “one” and lasts until you count “one” again.</p>
        <p>Most other notes values are derivatives of whole notes, but more on that later! </p>

        <h2>Half notes</h2>
        <p>Half notes, as you might have guessed, take up half as much space as the whole note.
            So if you’re counting and walking again, the first half note of the measure will start when you count “one” and the second when you count “three.</p>
        <p>Like so (the attack of the half note is in upper case letters) <b>ONE</b>-two-<b>THREE</b>-four, <b>ONE</b>-two-<b>THREE</b>-four etc. </p>
        <p>Two half notes sound like this, with a count in of four beats. Click on the staff above to play</p>

        <h2>Quarter notes</h2>
        <p>Quarter notes are simply put what you’ve just been counting and walking so far. In western music the most common time signature by far is 4/4 time, and quarter notes are the simplest way to define 4/4 time.</p>
        <p>It’s in the bass drum of a EDM tune, or in a break down of a song when the artist wants the audience to clap along to name but a few of instances where quarter notes occur. </p>

            <source src="audio/eighthnote_click_test.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>
        <h2>Eighth notes</h2>
        <p>Eighth notes are twice as fast as quarter notes. So whatever tempo you were imagining before, eighth notes are twice that. If you want to count along you can just add a “and” after each number. So 1-2-3-4 for quarter notes in 4/4 time becomes <b>1</b>-and-<b>2</b>-and-<b>3</b>-and-<b>4</b>-and for eighth notes in 4/4 time.</p>
        <p>Try switching between one measure of quarter notes, and one measure of eighth notes to get a feel for the eighth note rhythm.</p>

        <h2>Sixteenth notes</h2>
        <p>Last and actually least in this tutorial are the sixteenth notes, which depending on tempo can go by pretty quickly! Sixteenth notes are yet again twice as fast as eighth notes, and if you want to count again it’s a bit different than counting eighth notes being that it’s twice as fast.</p>
        <p>So instead of <b>1</b>-and-<b>2</b>-and-<b>3</b>-and-<b>4</b>-and, we now get <b>1</b>-eh-and-ah-<b>2</b>-eh-and-ah-<b>3</b>-eh-and-ah-<b>4</b>-eh-and-ah.</p>
